So, I also made a CV and tried to include everything that  was required,<br /> like the objective, an unordered list (ul), an ordered list (ol), and the address tag. I tried my best to include all of these in it.</p> </b> </big>

        <h2> <em> <u> graphic designing</u></em></h2>
        <h3>about : mara naam abdul rafay I have been doing graphic designing for 3 years, and I really enjoy it. I have created many things in graphic <br /> designing such as YouTube thumbnails, social media posts, posters, and much more. If you ever need any design made, just let me know.</h3> 

        <h2> <em><u>Web development</u></em></h2>
        <h3>about : For about two months, I kept thinking about whether or not I should do a web development course. Then I realized that with any skill, until you master it, you can’t really earn money from it. So, I decided to go for a development course, and I went to the <u> <em>Saylani Zaitoon Ashraf campus</u> </em>. When I visited, I really liked it, so I started the development course there, and today is the sixth day of my course.</h3>

        <h2><em><u>UI/UX design</u></em></h2>
        <h3>about : I don’t know UI/UX designing; I just wrote it down to make it look good.</h3>
